The normalizer aims to maximally reduce the variation between the orthography of texts written in the Anglo-Norman dialect
to bring it in line with “orthographe commune”. It is heavily inspired by Pope (1956).
Spelling variation is not consistent enough to ensure the highest accuracy; the normalizer in its current format should
therefore be used as a last resort.
